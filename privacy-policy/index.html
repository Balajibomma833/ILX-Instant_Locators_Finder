Last Updated: November 2025

1. Introduction

Instant Locators Finder (ILX) is a Chrome extension developed by Balaji Bomma.
It helps QA engineers and testers identify visible and actionable UI elements on webpages and export their locator information for automation purposes.

2. Information We Collect

ILX does NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).
ILX does not access or process:

Personal data

Sensitive information

Login or authentication data

Payment or financial information

Browsing history

User identity or profile information

3. What ILX Reads

ILX only analyzes the DOM of the active webpage to extract automation-related technical details such as:

Relative XPath

Element attributes

HTML tag type (button, link, input, etc.)

Visible text/labels of actionable elements

Accessibility-related attributes (if available)

This analysis is performed locally to generate an Excel (.xlsx) file for QA automation work.

4. Data Storage & Transfer

ILX does NOT:

Send any data to external servers

Transfer data over the internet

Store data outside the user’s device

Create background logs or analytics

All locator extraction and file generation happen completely locally in the user’s browser.
The generated Excel file is directly downloaded to the user’s computer.

5. Permissions Used

ILX uses only the minimal permissions required:

activeTab – to read the DOM of the currently active webpage

scripting – to inject the extraction script when the user clicks the button

No background services, tracking, or additional permissions are used.

6. Children’s Privacy

ILX does not collect any data and is inherently safe for all users.
However, it is a professional QA tool and not intended for use by children.

7. Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this Privacy Policy will be published in the Chrome Web Store listing and in the extension’s documentation.
